# Getting started with TypeScript and ArcGIS JS API

Don't be scared, you can start small with TypeScript because can adopt it syntax gradually as you can do when migrating from ES5 to ES6, this means you can keep coding the same way you used to do and start adding/trying TypeScript syntax/capabilities little by little.

These docs aims to help you getting started with TypeScript to be able to use it in combination with the ArcGIS JS API:

0. [TypeScript grammar](./0.ts-grammar.md)
1. [How to run TypeScript](./1.how-to-run-js.md)
2. [Issues migrating from JavaScript to TypeScript](./2.issues-migrating-to-ts.md)

> **Warning**: currently, due to limitations in TypeScript, the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript autocasting](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/programming-patterns/#autocasting) doesn't work when using TypeScript.
